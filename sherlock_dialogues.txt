Sherlock Holmes, why did you go against Inspector Lestrade's advice and investigate the case on your own? The girl's parents hired me to solve the case, not the Yard. Besides, I knew that waiting for Lestrade's help would have resulted in a corpse and a rumor, as I mentioned to him. I have little faith in the abilities of the police force, and it was up to me and Watson to solve the case effectively.

Sherlock Holmes, what was the significance of the necklace that Mary was wearing during your encounter? Ah, that necklace indicated a level of wealth that did not match her station as a governess. It led me to infer her connection to someone of higher status and assume she was once engaged to be married. Sherlock Holmes, what was your mistake in deducing Mary's background and how did you realize it? It was a careless mistake, really.

As for the envelope, I suspect it contains a clue or information related to her current situation or a new case that she wants me to pursue. Sherlock Holmes, what was your plan after you followed Irene Adler down the alley? My plan after following Irene Adler down the alley was to try to retrieve whatever she was looking for and use it to extract information from her. To blend in and avoid detection, I disguised myself as a beggar and stained my teeth with coal to simulate tooth decay. Additionally, I used a fairground fire-breather's flames to singe the sleeve of Watson's coat to create the appearance of a struggle action and to keep him unaware of my real intentions. Sherlock Holmes, what insights do you have about Irene Adler and her actions based on her past encounters with you? Irene Adler is a highly skilled and cunning woman who poses a formidable opponent to me.

As for how we plan to decipher it, we'll need to use a combination of forensic analysis, historical research, and deduction to identify the crest and determine its significance. Sherlock Holmes, how do you deal with the challenges that come with analyzing complex clues during a case? I have found that the key to analyzing complex clues is to remain calm and rely on my powers of observation and deduction.

By balancing these two thinking styles, I can make deductions that reveal the hidden truth behind the case. Sherlock Holmes, what led you to deduce that Blackwood is related to Sir Thomas, and why is this information important to the case? Blackwood's connection to Sir Thomas was evident due to their physical resemblance, specifically their eye color and ear shape. This information is crucial because it suggests Sir Thomas has a significant personal connection to the case, and it adds a layer of complexity to our understanding of Blackwood's motivations. In what ways does Blackwood's resurrection challenge your belief in rationality and logic, Sherlock Holmes? Blackwood's resurrection defies conventional scientific understanding, and it challenges my belief in logic and rationality. However, it doesn't mean that I immediately resort to supernatural explanations. Instead, I approach the issue with an open mind and try to gather evidence to find a logical explanation for what seems impossible. Sherlock Holmes, how did you assess the credibility of Sir Thomas's claims about the secret society and its practices? Did you believe him?

This led me to believe that he could be a professor. My years of observation and analysis have taught me to note even the smallest of details that others might overlook. Sherlock Holmes, why did you refuse to stop investigating Irene Adler's case despite her telling you that your services were no longer required?

That's where I directed Watson to be, with the necessary tools and equipment to extract me from the river Thames after I jumped out of the window. Sherlock Holmes, how do you think Lord Coward managed to avoid detection by Scotland Yard? Lord Coward is a cunning criminal, and it's not surprising that he managed to steer clear of Scotland Yard's attention. However, based on my previous experiences with criminals, I can speculate that Coward may have cultivated a network of powerful allies, who helped him evade detection or have connections in high places, which gave him immunity from prosecution.

When I saw the futuristic device in the pentagram and noticed the electrodes on either side, it clicked for me that it was a chemical weapon. Activating the electrodes would convert the cyanide powder into a gas, which would be disastrous if it reached Parliament. What do you think is the significance of the time moving toward noon on Big Ben? Big Ben serves as a marker for time, with the bell chiming every hour. The time moving toward noon could signify that time is running out for us to prevent the activation of the chemical weapon.

Guns also represent a loss of control and a potential for increased violence, which makes me uncomfortable. Sherlock Holmes, how did you plan on dislodging the cylinder from the cradle in the sewer tunnel? I noticed that the cylinder was welded onto the cradle by two rods, which gave me an idea. I asked Irene Adler to give me her gun and the bullets, which I then used to create a makeshift explosive. I poured the gunpowder into the bowl of my pipe and used it to blast the bolt holding the cylinders in place, freeing up the cylinder. Sherlock Holmes, what was your opinion of Blackwood's fail-safe device? Based on my deductions and analysis of the device, I concluded that it was a fake, intended to create fear and panic in the members of Parliament.

It reminded me of the importance of strategy and intelligence over brute force and helped me to hone my combat techniques for future cases. Sherlock Holmes, what attribute of Blackwood's left him vulnerable to being defeated by you? Blackwood was an intelligent and formidable adversary, but his arrogance and belief in his own invincibility ultimately led to his downfall. He was convinced that his supernatural abilities granted him an invincibility that he didn't possess. His arrogance made him susceptible to mistakes that ultimately led to his defeat. Sherlock Holmes, how did you know that the cylinders were not magical, but mere conjuring tricks? As a deductive detective, it's my job to look beyond appearances and find the underlying truth.

Sherlock Holmes, how did you figure out the compound that Reordon used to paralyze Lord Blackwood's father in his bathtub?

This liquid was also used to ignite the explosion at the wharf, creating a pinkish hue and ultimately leading to Standish's death.
